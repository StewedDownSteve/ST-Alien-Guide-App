# ST-Alien-Guide-App
An app I made to practice creating API's and using JavaScript to fetch them. A field guide to Stark Trek aliens.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MongoDB, CSS, HTML, JavaScript

Used an awesome front-end template to get the Star Trek vibe. Then, I added in Javascript to fetch data from a simple API that has some of the Star Trek aliens, with info and a photo.

## Optimizations
This was more about getting successful fetch requests from an API with JavaScript. If I went back I would use a different API and I would make my own front-end styling.

## Lessons Learned:

More practice with MongoDb and being able to successfully fetch API. This was a lot of fun and was a good stepping stone!
